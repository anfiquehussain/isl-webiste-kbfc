                        <p>Kerala Blasters played their inaugural match on 13 October 2014, losing 1–0 to NorthEast
                            United FC. Despite the loss, the club quickly became one of the most popular in the ISL,
                            thanks to its passionate fan base known as the Manjappada (Yellow Army).</p>

                        <p>In the 2014 ISL season, Kerala Blasters finished second in the regular season and reached the
                            final, where they lost 1–0 to ATK FC. The following season, the club finished third in the
                            regular season and reached the semi-finals, where they lost to Chennaiyin FC.</p>
